## Usage Notes

### CI410

This section features a LaTeX document that must be prepared using `texlive` (or equivalent). My method involves using `texlive` and `biber`, both available on Ubuntu and Pop!\_OS's default 20.10 repositories, which is what I use. The process for building this document by yourself may differ depending on your OS! This being said, there's a copy of the report available in the [CI410 Releases Tag](https://github.com/summerysaturn/y1-university/releases/tag/CI410), under the 'Assignment 1 Essay'.

### CI435

This section features a static site. This segment is still under development, even if the assignment is considered "done". This is because the only extra parts to add are extra posts. Once the deadline rolls around I'll push it to the gh-pages branch and add it as a release. In the meantime, this site is viewable at <http://ci435-01.kmjw10.brighton.domains/index.html>.
